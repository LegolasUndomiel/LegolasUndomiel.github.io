## Experimental details and damage characterization

>The impact response of clustered [0/90] and [90/0] laminates, and of dispersed [0/90] laminates was considered in the study.
>Clustered laminates have grouped 0 and 90 layers and two 0/90 interfaces, while dispersed laminates are characterized by interspersed 0 and 90 layers and ten 0/90 interfaces.

研究中考虑了群集的[0/90]和[90/0]层压板以及分散的[0/90]层压板的冲击响应。
聚集的层压板有分组的0和90层以及两个0/90接口，而分散的层压板的特点是0和90层穿插在一起，有十个0/90接口。

>For all stacking sequences, laminated panels 600 x 600 mm in size were hand laid-up with unidirectional Seal HS160/REM graphite/epoxy prepreg tapes (61.5% fibre content in weight), vacuum bagged and then consolidated in an autoclave following a curing cycle with a pressure of 8 bar and a maximum temperature of 160 C.
>Rectangular specimens 65 x 87.5 mm in size and with an average thickness of 2.0 mm were finally cut from the laminated panels after curing.

对于所有的堆叠序列，尺寸为600x600毫米的层压板用单向的Seal HS160/REM石墨/环氧树脂预浸带（纤维含量占重量的61.5%）手工铺设，真空装袋，然后在压力为8巴、最高温度为160摄氏度的固化循环后在高压釜中固化。
矩形试样尺寸为65x87.5毫米，平均厚度为2.0毫米，最终在固化后从层压板上切割下来。

>The specimens were impacted on a drop-weight impact testing machine using a 2.3 kg falling mass with a hemispherical nose steel tup of 12. 5 mm diameter; the impact tester was provided with a pneumatic braking system capable of capturing the falling mass after the first rebound in order to prevent multiple impacts on the specimen.
>The samples were simply supported on a steel plate having a 45 m  67.5 mm rectangular opening, and impact energies in the range between 0.5 and 7 J (corresponding to impact velocities between 0.7 m/s and 2.5 m/s) were obtained by varying the drop height of the impactor.
>The impact force signal was acquired by a semiconductor strain-gauge bridge bonded to the tup, while impact and rebound velocities were measured by using an infrared sensor/emitter that detects the signals reflected by a three-stripe flag attached to the impactor.

试样在落锤式冲击试验机上受到冲击，使用2.3公斤的落锤，直径为12.5毫米的半球形钢锥；冲击试验机配备了气动制动系统，能够在第一次反弹后捕捉落锤，以防止对试样的多次冲击。
试样被简单地支撑在一块具有45米67.5毫米矩形开口的钢板上，通过改变冲击器的下落高度，获得了0.5到7焦耳的冲击能量（对应于0.7米/秒到2.5米/秒的冲击速度）。
冲击力信号是由粘接在tup上的半导体应变计桥获得的，而冲击和反弹速度是通过使用红外传感器/发射器来测量的，该传感器/发射器检测由连接在冲击器上的三条纹旗反射的信号。

>The damage induced in laminated composites by low-velocity impacts typically consists of a combination of different fracture events that develop with a complicated three-dimensional morphology [1,3].
>A series of evaluation techniques, including both non-destructive (X-radiography, ultrasonics, and direct observation of sample faces) and destructive techniques (thermal deply), were therefore adopted in this study for damage assessment.

低速冲击在层压复合材料中引起的损坏 通常由不同的断裂事件组合而成，形成复杂的三维形态[1,3]。
因此，本研究采用了一系列的评估技术，包括非破坏性的（X射线照相术、超声波和直接观察样品表面）和破坏性的技术（热分解），来进行损伤评估。

>Penetrant enhanced X-radiography (whereby the damaged sample is X-rayed after infiltration of a radio-opaque zinc iodide solution to enhance the contrast of damaged regions) made it possible to obtain a very detailed projected picture of fracture modes in impacted specimens.
>This technique suffers however from two main weaknesses: (i) delamination and matrix cracks that are not connected to the surface are impossible to infiltrate with the zinc solution and may remain undetected and (ii) only a planar projection of through-thickness damage is achieved, and no reliable information on the depth location of individual fracture modes may be easily acquired.

渗透剂增强型X射线照相术（即在不透射线的碘化锌溶液浸润后对受损样品进行X射线照相，以增强受损区域的对比度）使其有可能获得受冲击试样中断裂模式的非常详细的投影图。
然而，这种技术有两个主要弱点。(i) 与表面不相连的分层和基体裂缝不可能被锌溶液浸润，因此可能无法检测到；(ii) 只能获得贯穿整个厚度的损伤的平面投影，不容易获得关于单个断裂模式的深度位置的可靠信息。

>Ultrasonic evaluation was thus used to reveal these forms of hidden damage and to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction of internal delaminations.
>The specimens were immersed in water and scanned at a normal angle of incidence in pulse-echo mode by a focussed 50 MHz transducer.
>During scanning, the entire reflected ultrasonic waveforms were digitized at uniformly spaced points and stored in a database representing the three-dimensional internal structure of the laminate; amplitude C-scans showing a slice of the material at the desired through-thickness location were finally reconstructed by consulting the acquired database for visualization of internal delaminations on a ply-by-ply basis.

因此，超声评估被用来揭示这些形式的隐性损伤，并获得内部分层的三维重建。
试样被浸泡在水中，用一个聚焦的50MHz换能器以正常入射角扫描。
在扫描过程中，整个反射的超声波波形在均匀间隔的点上被数字化，并存储在代表层压板三维内部结构的数据库中；通过查阅获得的数据库，最终重建了显示材料在所需厚度位置的切片的振幅C扫描，以便在逐层基础上可视化内部分层。

>A ‘‘shadow” effect masking the presence of deeper damage may however occur if delaminations close to the transducer totally reflect the ultrasonic beam [3]; to limit this effect, all the specimens were ultrasonically scanned from both the impact and the rear face and the information obtained recombined to a single image.
>This approach permits a full reconstruction of the through-thickness delamination pattern in [0/90] and [90/0] laminates (where delaminations may only occur on two interfaces), but it is obviously not adequate for a complete characterization of interlaminar damage in [0/90] laminates, in which multiple overlapping delaminations develop at various interfaces.

然而，如果靠近换能器的分层完全反射超声束，就会出现掩盖深层损伤存在的 "阴影 "效应[3]；为了限制这种效应，所有试样都从冲击面和背面进行超声扫描，并将获得的信息重新组合成一张图像。
这种方法可以完全重建[0/90]和[90/0]层压板的穿透性分层模式（分层可能只发生在两个界面上），但是对于[0/90]层压板的层间损伤的完整描述显然是不够的，在不同的界面上会出现多个重叠的分层。

>The internal damage of a number of [0/90] specimens was therefore destructively examined by thermal deply [23,24].
>After immersion in a zinc iodide solution, impacted laminates were heated in an oven at 600 C for 5 min so as to partially pyrolize the resin rich interface regions and thus permit the separation of individual plies.
>Digital images of the faces of the deplied layers were finally acquired by an optical scanner for direct observation and measurement of delaminated areas, as marked by traces of zinc iodide on the surfaces of individual layers.

因此，一些[0/90]试样的内部损坏是通过热分解[23,24]进行破坏性检查的。
在碘化锌溶液中浸泡后，受影响的层压板在600摄氏度的烤箱中加热5分钟，以使富含树脂的界面区域部分热化，从而允许分离各个层。
最后用光学扫描仪获取被分离层表面的数字图像，以便直接观察和测量脱层区域，如个别层表面上的碘化锌痕迹所标志的。

## Finite element model

>The potential of interface elements based on a bilinear decohesion failure model to predict the damage induced by low-velocity impacts on laminated panels was explored in a previous paper by the authors [22].
>The parameters defining the cohesive behaviour of the interface were first identified by comparing numerical results with experimental data obtained by static mode I (DCB) and mode II (ENF) fracture tests on unidirectional laminates.
>Cohesive interface elements were then used in a 3D FE model to simulate the onset and propagation of matrix fracture modes in impacted [0/90] graphite/epoxy laminates.

作者在以前的一篇论文中[22]探讨了基于双线性解聚失效模型的界面元素在预测低速冲击对层压板引起的破坏方面的潜力。
通过比较数值结果和单向层压板的静态模式I（DCB）和模式II（ENF）断裂试验得到的实验数据，首先确定了定义界面内聚行为的参数。
然后，在一个三维FE模型中使用粘性界面元素来模拟冲击[0/90]石墨/环氧树脂层压板中基体断裂模式的发生和传播。

>In this paper, the predictive capabilities of the model are further evaluated by simulating the impact response of clustered ([90/0]) and dispersed ([0/90]) cross-ply laminates.
>It is worth noting that the damage pattern of [90/0] laminates is similar to that occurring in [0/90] laminates, except that the principal axis of the delamination is oriented along the 90 direction, as opposed to the 0 direction of [0/90] laminates.
>Dispersed [0/90] laminates exhibit, on the other hand, an extremely complex damage scenario, characterized by multiple delaminations developing with different shapes, sizes and orientations along the various interfaces across the thickness of the laminate.

在本文中，通过模拟集群（[90/0]）和分散（[0/90]）交叉层压板的冲击响应，进一步评估了该模型的预测能力。
值得注意的是，[90/0]层压板的破坏模式与[0/90]层压板发生的破坏模式相似，只是分层的主轴是沿90方向的，而不是[0/90]层压板的0方向。
另一方面，分散的[0/90]层压板表现出极其复杂的破坏情况，其特点是在整个层压板的厚度上，沿不同的界面出现不同形状、大小和方向的多个分层。

>Finite element analyses were carried out with the parallel explicit solver of the commercial code Abaqus 6.5, and a user defined subroutine (vumat) was developed for implementation of the cohesive behaviour of interface elements.
>Explicit solution of the dynamic equilibrium equations is particularly suited to the study of short-time events such as low-velocity impacts, whose duration is typically of the order of a few milliseconds.
>Moreover, explicit time-integration procedures provide superior convergence behaviour and higher parallelization efficiency [25] over implicit FE solutions.

有限元分析是用商业代码Abaqus 6.5的并行显式求解器进行的，并开发了一个用户定义的子程序（vumat）来实现界面元素的粘着行为。
动态平衡方程的显式求解特别适用于研究短时事件，如低速撞击，其持续时间通常为几毫秒。
此外，显式时间积分程序提供了比隐式FE解决方案更好的收敛行为和更高的并行化效率[25]。

>**Various cohesive traction–displacement constitutive equations have been proposed in the literature to represent the softening and fracture response of an interface [26].**
>Many studies indicate however that the numerical results show little sensitivity to the shape of the cohesive law [27,28]; a bilinear constitutive law, which is possibly the most widely adopted cohesive curve, was thus used in this investigation because of its implementation simplicity.
>The adopted cohesive behaviour of the interface under mode I and modes II/III follows the bilinear laws illustrated in Fig. 1, which relate the normal (mode I) or the tangential (modes II/III) tractions to the corresponding separation of the upper and lower cohesive surfaces, and where the areas under the traction–separation curves are assumed to correspond to mode I and mode II/III fracture energies.
>The traction–separation laws consist of an initial linear elastic stage until a maximum stress is reached, followed by a linear softening phase that simulates the progressive decohesion of the interface with increasing damage.
>Complete fracture of the interface is assumed to occur when cohesive tractions vanish at the end of the softening phase.
>Unloading occurring after damage onset follows a linear path with reduced stiffness directly towards the origin; the original value of the normal stiffness is, however, restored under compressive loadings so as to preclude interpenetration of material at a delaminated interface.

**文献中提出了各种粘性牵引-位移构成方程来表示界面的软化和断裂反应[26]。**
然而，许多研究表明，数值结果对内聚力法的形状几乎不敏感[27,28]；双线性构成法可能是最广泛采用的内聚力曲线，由于其实施简单，因此在本研究中使用。
所采用的界面在模式I和模式II/III下的内聚行为遵循图1所示的双线性定律，它将法向（模式I）或切向（模式II/III）牵引力与上下内聚面的相应分离联系起来，并假定牵引力分离曲线下的区域对应于模式I和模式II/III的断裂能量。
牵引力分离规律包括一个初始的线性弹性阶段，直到达到最大应力，然后是线性软化阶段，模拟界面随着损伤的增加而逐渐解聚。
当软化阶段结束时内聚力消失时，界面的完全断裂就会发生。
损伤发生后的卸载遵循一个线性路径，刚度直接向原点降低；然而，在压缩载荷下，法向刚度的原始值被恢复，以排除材料在分层界面的相互渗透。

>The choice of an appropriate criterion for prediction of matrix damage initiation under complex stress states is still a subject of much debate, since many unresolved issues, such as the apparent increase of shear strength under compressive loading, in situ effects, the influence of material non-linearity, the adoption of a characteristic length, etc., remain to be clarified [29,30].

选择一个合适的标准来预测复杂应力状态下的基体损伤的发生，仍然是一个争论不休的话题，因为许多未解决的问题，如压缩载荷下剪切强度的明显增加、原位效应、材料非线性的影响、采用特征长度等，仍然有待澄清[29,30]。

>In this study, an empirical stress-based prediction scheme, based on the criterion proposed in [31], which includes the strengthening effect of through-thickness compression on the shear strength of the interface and which was validated by experimental results for low-velocity impacts, was adopted for prediction of delamination initiation.
>The criterion predicts the onset of interface damage in the presence of a combination of normal (tn) and shear (ts, tt) stresses by the use of the following equations.

在这项研究中，采用了基于经验的应力预测方案，该方案基于[31]中提出的标准，其中包括通厚压缩对界面剪切强度的加强作用，并通过低速冲击的实验结果进行了验证，用于预测分层的启动。
该标准通过使用以下公式预测在法向（tn）和剪切（ts, tt）应力组合存在的情况下界面损伤的开始。

>**The ultimate failure of the element was controlled by the linear interaction criterion of Eq. (2), where the critical fracture energies GIC, GIIC and GIIIC are specified as material properties and the mode I component was ignored in the case of compressive stresses.**
>GIC and GIIC values were experimentally obtained in a previous study [22] by DCB and ENF tests, while the value of GIIIC was assumed equal to GIIC because of the lack of experimental data concerning the fracture properties of the material under mode III. 
>It should be remarked that GIIIC values are usually higher than GIIC values and thus the GIIIC = GIIC assumption may be among the reasons for the discrepancies between predictions and experiments observed, as described in the next section, in dispersed cross-ply laminates.

元件的极限破坏由公式（2）的线性相互作用准则控制，其中临界断裂能量GIC、GIIC和GIIIC被指定为材料属性，在压缩应力的情况下，**模式I成分被忽略。**
GIC和GIIC值是在以前的研究中[22]通过DCB和ENF测试获得的，而GIIIC的值被假设为等于GIIC，因为缺乏关于模式III下材料断裂特性的实验数据。
应该指出的是，GIIIC值通常高于GIIC值，因此GIIIC = GIIC的假设可能是导致预测和实验之间差异的原因之一，如下一节所述，在分散的交叉层压板中。

>The progression of damage is monitored by the scalar damage indicator d, which ranges from the initial value of 0 (undamaged interface) to the value of 1 (complete decohesion of the interface, with physical separation of the cohesive surfaces).

损伤的进展由标量损伤指标d监测，其范围从初始值0（未损伤的界面）到值1（界面完全解体，粘性表面物理分离）。

>**Because of symmetry, only one quarter of the specimen was built and analysed (Fig. 2).**
>**Boundary conditions matching those of experimentally tested samples were applied by imposing zero vertical displacement constraints to nodes lying along the edges of the support plate.**

**由于对称性，只建立和分析了四分之一的试样（图2）。**
**通过对位于支撑板边缘的节点施加零垂直位移约束，应用了与实验测试的样品相匹配的边界条件。**

>In clustered [0/90] and [90/0] laminates, 0 and 90 sublaminates were modelled through their thickness with two C3D8R reduced integration solid elements with enhanced hourglass control, while COH3D8 cohesive elements were inserted at the two interfaces between layers with different orientation (0/90 interface and 90/0 interface).
>To simulate the initiation and growth of the major intralaminar matrix crack (bending crack), typically developing along the fibre direction in the lower block of layers of clustered cross-ply laminates [1,18], two rows of vertical cohesive elements, sharing the nodes of adjacent solid elements, were also placed on the symmetry plane of the laminates (i.e. on the boundary of the quarter model) parallel to the 0 direction for [0/90] samples (as visible in Fig. 2) and to the 90 direction for [90/0] laminates.
>Preliminary convergence analyses showed no significant differences in numerical results, with respect to this mesh configuration, when modelling sublaminates with four through-thickness solid elements and the intralaminar crack with four rows of vertical cohesive elements.
>The cohesive properties of Table 1 were used for modelling the intralaminar crack.

在群集的[0/90]和[90/0]层压板中，0和90子层压板通过其厚度用两个具有增强沙漏控制的C3D8R减少集成实体元素进行建模，而COH3D8内聚元素被插入到不同方向的层压板之间的两个界面（0/90界面和90/0界面）。
为了模拟主要的层内基体裂纹（弯曲裂纹）的发生和增长，通常在簇状交叉层板的下层块中沿纤维方向发展[1,18]，两排垂直粘性元素，共享相邻实体元素的节点，也被放置在层板的对称平面上（即四分之一模型的边界上），对于[0/90]样品平行于0方向（如图2中可见），对于[90/0]层板垂直于90方向。
初步收敛分析表明，在用四个穿透性实体元素对子层板进行建模和用四行垂直粘性元素对层内裂缝进行建模时，就这种网格配置而言，数值结果没有明显的差异。
表1的内聚力特性被用于模拟层内裂缝。

>In dispersed [0/90] laminates, 0 and 90 plies were modelled through the thickness with one C3D8R solid element, and the 10 interfaces between 0 and 90 layers were simulated by COH3D8 cohesive elements.
>**Unlike clustered laminates, as explained in the following section, no vertical cohesive elements were used to simulate intralaminar matrix cracks in [0/90] laminates**.

在分散的[0/90]层压板中，0层和90层用一个C3D8R实体单元进行厚度模拟，0层和90层之间的10个界面用COH3D8粘性单元进行模拟。
**与集群层压板不同的是，正如下一节所解释的，在[0/90]层压板中没有使用垂直粘性元素来模拟层内基体裂缝。**

>A refined mesh consisting of elements with 0.25 mm sides (on the laminate plane) was used on the damaged area for both clustered and dispersed laminates.
>**Fine mesh regions were 10 x 25 mm, 22.5 x 15 mm and 10 x 10 mm in size (with reference to the quarter model) for [0/90], [90/0] and [0/90] laminates, respectively**.

对于群集和分散的层压板，由边长为0.25毫米的元素组成的精细网格被用在受损区域。
**对于[0/90]、[90/0]和[0/90]层压板，细网区域的尺寸分别为10x25毫米、22.5x15毫米和10x10毫米（参考四分之一的模型）。**

>**The impactor was modelled as a quarter of a rigid hemispherical body, with an assigned mass of 2.3/4 kg, and impacts of different energies were simulated by imposing to the impactor the appropriate velocities at the instant of contact.**
>The interaction between the plate and the indentor was simulated by surface-to-surface contact elements connecting the impactor and laminate surfaces.

**冲击器被建模为刚性半球形体的四分之一，质量为2.3/4公斤，通过在接触瞬间对冲击器施加适当的速度，模拟不同能量的冲击。**
板材和压头之间的相互作用是通过连接撞击器和层压板表面的表面对表面接触元素来模拟的。

>The analyses were carried out on a distributed-memory cluster system of five Linux workstations with two 3.4 GHz Pentium D processors, for a total of 10 CPUs.
>The domain-level decomposition available in the MPI-based parallel solver of ABAQUS/Explicit was used for the calculations.

分析是在一个由五个Linux工作站组成的分布式内存集群系统上进行的，其中有两个3.4GHz的奔腾D处理器，总共有10个CPU。
ABAQUS/Explicit基于MPI的并行求解器中的域级分解被用于计算。

## Results and discussion

>Numerical results concerning the simulation of the impact behaviour of [0/90] laminates and comparisons with experimental analyses are illustrated in a previous paper [22] and only a brief summary is reported below for completeness.
>For this stacking sequence, experimental observations indicate that damage starts as a major bending matrix crack in the 0 layers farthest from the impact face, followed by shear matrix cracks and by a peanut shape delamination that develops at the lowermost 90/0 interface with the major axis oriented along the fibre direction of the lower ply of the interface (0 direction).
>Small delaminations appear at the top 0/90 interface of the laminate at an impact energy of about 7 J, while significant fibre fracture only occurs from impact energy levels of about 8 J.
>The response to impact of [0/90] samples was modelled in [22] for impact energies up to 7 J and the simulated results were found to be in good accordance with the experimental findings in terms of both force history and key damage features (Fig. 3).
>In particular, the FE analyses correctly predicted the sequence of the major damage events (bending matrix crack followed first by delamination of the bottom interface and then by delamination of the top interface) and the size, shape and orientation of delaminations (Figs. 3 and 4).
>A value of the damage variable d equal to unity (corresponding to the total decohesion of the element) was assumed to define the delaminated area of the simulation.

有关[0/90]层压板冲击行为的模拟以及与实验分析的比较的数值结果在以前的一篇论文[22]中说明，为了完整起见，下面只报告一个简短的摘要。
对于这种堆叠顺序，实验观察表明，破坏开始于离冲击面最远的0层的主要弯曲基体裂纹，然后是剪切基体裂纹和在最下层的90/0接口处出现的花生状分层，其主轴沿接口下层（0方向）的纤维方向排列。
在冲击能量约为7J时，层压板最上面的0/90界面出现小的分层，而显著的纤维断裂只发生在冲击能量约为8J的水平。
在[22]中对[0/90]样品的冲击响应进行了建模，冲击能量最高为7J，模拟结果与实验结果在受力历史和关键损伤特征方面都很一致（图3）。
特别是，FE分析正确地预测了主要损伤事件的顺序（首先是弯曲的基体裂纹，其次是底部界面的分层，然后是顶部界面的分层）以及分层的大小、形状和方向（图3和4）。
假设损伤变量d的值等于1（对应于元素的总解聚），以定义模拟的分层区域。

>The sequence of fracture modes occurring under impact in [90/0] samples is similar to that summarized above for [0/90] laminates.
>Damage initiate at an impact energy of approximately 0.5 J, and consists again of a main intralaminar matrix crack in the lower block of 90 laminae, followed by a delamination that develops with the typical two-lobe shape on the adjacent 0/90 interface.
>With increasing impact energies, the delamination tends to propagate along the fibre direction of the lower ply of the interface (90 direction), until, for an impact energy of about 3 J, the front of the delaminated area reaches the edges of the supporting frame.
>No fibre fracture was observed in this class of laminates over the range of examined impact energies (0.5–3.5 J).

在[90/0]样品中发生的断裂模式的顺序与上面总结的[0/90]层压板相似。
损伤开始于大约0.5焦耳的冲击能量，同样由90层板下部块的主要层内基体裂纹组成，随后在相邻的0/90界面上形成典型的两叶状分层。
随着冲击能量的增加，分层倾向于沿着界面下部层的纤维方向（90方向）传播，直到在冲击能量约为3J时，分层区域的前端到达支撑框架的边缘。
在研究的冲击能量范围内（0.5-3.5J），没有观察到该类层压板的纤维断裂。

>On the basis of the observed damage features, the simulation of the impact behaviour of [90/0] laminates was limited to the range of impact energies between 0.5 J and 2.5 J, chosen so as to avoid the analysis of impacts that induce delaminated areas extending beyond the opening of the support.

根据观察到的损伤特征，[90/0]层压板的冲击行为模拟被限制在0.5J和2.5J之间的冲击能量范围内，这样选择是为了避免分析那些引起分层区域延伸到支撑开口之外的冲击。

>Comparisons between numerical predictions and experimental results from tests on [90/0] laminates are summarized in Figs. 5–8, where various parameters (bending crack length and delamination area, length and width) are used to characterize matrix damage in impacted samples.

图5-8总结了数值预测和[90/0]层压板测试的实验结果之间的比较，各种参数（弯曲裂纹长度和分层面积、长度和宽度）被用来描述受冲击样品中的基体损伤。

>We notice that force–time histories are correctly simulated by the model (Fig. 5) and that good agreement is achieved between experimental data and model predictions with regard to the various metrics adopted to describe the main damage features (Figs. 5–7).
>As visible in Fig. 6, the model is able to reproduce the twolobe shape of the damaged area and to predict the principal orientation of the delamination (with its main axis oriented along the 90 direction).
>The variation of the aspect ratio of the delaminated lobes with impact energy is also correctly captured by the model without resorting to complex adaptive techniques for iteratively adjusting the mesh to the varying shape of the delamination front.
>As shown in Fig. 8, a reasonable agreement is also obtained between numerical and experimental force–displacement curves, even though, as expected, the model underestimates the energy absorbed during impact, since various energy dissipation mechanisms occurring during the test, such as frictional effects, matrix crushing around the indentor, material nonlinearity, etc., are not included in the simulation.

我们注意到，模型正确地模拟了力的时间历史（图5），在描述主要损伤特征的各种指标方面，实验数据和模型预测之间取得了良好的一致（图5-7）。
如图6所示，该模型能够再现受损区域的双叶形状，并预测分层的主要方向（其主轴沿90方向）。
分层裂片的长宽比随冲击能量的变化也被模型正确地捕捉到，而不需要借助于复杂的自适应技术来迭代调整网格以适应分层前沿的变化形状。
如图8所示，数值和实验的力-位移曲线之间也取得了合理的一致，尽管如预期的那样，模型低估了冲击过程中吸收的能量，因为试验过程中发生的各种能量耗散机制，如摩擦效应、压头周围的基体破碎、材料非线性等，都没有包括在模拟中。

>Somewhat surprisingly, in view of the fact that the initiation and growth of delaminations are known to be affected by the presence of pre-existing matrix cracks in adjacent layers [18,32], the developed FE models proved to be able to simulate with good accuracy the progression of impact delamination in clustered cross-ply laminates without accounting for the pattern of matrix cracks developing in inner layers.
>Analogous results were achieved in recent simulation studies [19–21], in which acceptable predictions of impact damage on cross-ply laminates could be obtained without considering the presence of intralaminar matrix damage.
>These findings suggest that further analyses may be needed to clarify the role played by the different damage modes on the impact response of this class of laminates.

有点令人惊讶的是，鉴于分层的开始和增长已知受到相邻层中预先存在的基体裂纹的影响[18,32]，开发的FE模型被证明能够很准确地模拟集群交叉层压板中冲击分层的进展，而不考虑内层中基体裂纹的发展模式。
最近的模拟研究[19-21]也取得了类似的结果，在不考虑层内基体损伤的情况下，可以获得对交叉层压板冲击损伤的可接受的预测。
这些研究结果表明，可能需要进一步分析，以澄清不同的损伤模式对这一类层压板的冲击响应所起的作用。
